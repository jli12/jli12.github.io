Hey there, thanks for stopping by. I'm Jason, and there's a picture of me on the right uncharacteristically not smiling to show a different side of me, since I'll probably be smiling if you see me in person.
<!-- Perpetually curious, perpetually foolish, perpetually adventurous.  -->

Currently I'm a master's student studying Computational Neuroscience, jointly enrolled at ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich. I've just started writing my thesis on modeling an aspect of human memory systems using Artificial Neural Networks at RIKEN in Japan, under the joint supervision of [Dr. Louis Kang](https://louiskang.group) of RIKEN and [Professor Benjamin Grewe](https://grewelab.org/biography/) of ETH Zurich. 

Outside of my academics, I keep myself busy through a multitude of activities, such as [photography](http://jasonfli12.myportfolio.com), triathlon training, rock climbing, [baking](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1565apuy314wg1u/AABiBvJeQZnzUj34YWZdcw1Fa?dl=0), learning new languages, etc. I'm also a very avid traveler, having lived extensively in 5 countries across 3 continents (USA, Hong Kong, France, Switzerland, Japan) and having visited 43 countries.

I don't know how I may be of assistance, but in general feel free to reach out to me via any of the methods below :) cheers

<!-- Academically, I have an expansive set of interests ranging across Neuroscience/Biology, Physics, Philosphy, Mathematics


By now, I've lived extensively in 5 countries across 3 continents (USA, Hong Kong, France, Switzerland, Japan) and have visited 43 countries. 

I like to think of myself as an avid learner above all else, and the two quotes above seem to encapsulate this disposition best.

I'm fascinated by a range of by topics across Neuroscience, Physics, and Philosophy such as: the neural bases of memory, the emergence of group dynamics from individuals, the way our intangible minds interface our flesh with the world to derive physicality when everything is ultimately a wave, and on and on. Through the use of Theoretical/Computational techniques, I hope to be able to elucidate \[at least some of\] these questions, as well as any and all others I develop along the way.

Outside of my academics, I enjoy staying active through swimming, running, and biking (though I wouldn't consider it triathlon training just yet) as well as bouldering. I also greatly enjoy [baking](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1565apuy314wg1u/AABiBvJeQZnzUj34YWZdcw1Fa?dl=0)-- sourdough based goods especially-- and cooking in general, and maintain (to the best of my ability) [this photography portfolio](portfolio/portfolioHome.html). Oh, and in my copious free time, I do very much enjoy ruminating over various ontological and epistemological questions as well :) -->
