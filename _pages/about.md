Hey there, thanks for stopping by. I'm Jason. Perpetually curious, perpetually foolish, perpetually adventurous. 

<!-- Academically, I have an expansive set of interests ranging across Neuroscience/Biology, Physics, Philosphy, Mathematics


By now, I've lived extensively in 5 countries across 3 continents (USA, Hong Kong, France, Switzerland, Japan) and have visited 43 countries. 

I like to think of myself as an avid learner above all else, and the two quotes above seem to encapsulate this disposition best.

I'm fascinated by a range of by topics across Neuroscience, Physics, and Philosophy such as: the neural bases of memory, the emergence of group dynamics from individuals, the way our intangible minds interface our flesh with the world to derive physicality when everything is ultimately a wave, and on and on. Through the use of Theoretical/Computational techniques, I hope to be able to elucidate \[at least some of\] these questions, as well as any and all others I develop along the way.

Outside of my academics, I enjoy staying active through swimming, running, and biking (though I wouldn't consider it triathlon training just yet) as well as bouldering. I also greatly enjoy [baking](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1565apuy314wg1u/AABiBvJeQZnzUj34YWZdcw1Fa?dl=0)-- sourdough based goods especially-- and cooking in general, and maintain (to the best of my ability) [this photography portfolio](portfolio/portfolioHome.html). Oh, and in my copious free time, I do very much enjoy ruminating over various ontological and epistemological questions as well :) -->
